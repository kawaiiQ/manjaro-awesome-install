# manjaro-awesome-install

This repo contains some scripts that automatically install software that I often use in Manjaro-Awesome edition.

I mainly use this just after I reinstalled my system. 😂

## Scripts

* **install.sh**: install everything
* **select-mirrors**: select fastest mirrors in China
* **update-softwares**: update installed softwares
* **setup-fonts**: install nesessary fonts, especially Chinese fonts
* **setup-vim-ide**: setup development environment, setup vim -- the best code editor 😏
